What does the wizard do?
========================

This extension will allow you to duplicate a complete site inside the TYPO3 CMS, including all data and settings. The new site will be completely configured and ready to use for a new editor.

In order to achieve that your template needs to provide instructions how parts of it are configured, and how some UID's (or other data) might need to be reconfigured or translated.

The target / focus for this extension are installations with multiple sites, and maybe multiple templates/themes, where creating new sites are a regular task, like in website builders or website creation platforms.

The "*sudhaus7_wizard*" extension offers possibilities for templates or site packages to give the site admin configurable theme options, like variations, colors and behaviour switches individual to the template or site package.
